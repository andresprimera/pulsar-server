# Channel credential fallback from environment

When a channel config has **no credentials** (or invalid/incomplete credentials) in the DB, the channel layer can use **platform authentication credentials** from the environment as fallback.

**Routing identifiers** (phoneNumberId, instagramAccountId, tiktokUserId) are **never** read from `.env`. They must always be stored per client in the database and determine which client integration handles a message.

## Behavior

- **Routing identifiers** → always from DB (per-client channel config).
- **Authentication credentials** (accessToken, apiKey) → from DB when present and valid; otherwise from `.env` fallback.
- **Both credential sources missing** → runtime error with a clear message.

## Environment variables (authentication only)

`.env` provides **only platform-level authentication credentials**, not routing identifiers.

### WhatsApp Meta

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WHATSAPP_META_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Access token (fallback when DB credentials missing) |

### WhatsApp Dialog360

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WHATSAPP_DIALOG360_API_KEY` | API key (fallback when DB credentials missing) |

### WhatsApp Twilio

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `WHATSAPP_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio account SID (auth only; routing identifier always from DB, never from env) |
| `WHATSAPP_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Twilio auth token (auth only; routing identifier always from DB, never from env) |

### Instagram

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Access token (fallback when DB credentials missing) |

### TikTok

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Access token (fallback when DB credentials missing) |

## Startup validation

`ChannelEnvValidator` runs at application startup. If a credential env var is set, it must be valid; otherwise the application fails to start with an explicit error.

## Architecture

- **Routing identifiers** → always from DB (orchestrator passes `routeChannelIdentifier` from channel config to the channel layer).
- **Credential resolution** → channel layer only; orchestrator does not read `.env`.
- DB credentials remain encrypted at rest; env credentials are runtime-only and not stored in the DB.
- Multi-tenant routing is preserved: each client’s channel config stores its own routing IDs in the DB.
